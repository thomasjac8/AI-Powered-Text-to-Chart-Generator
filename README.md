# AI-Powered-Text-to-Chart-Generator
Developed a Streamlit-based Text-to-Chart App with Pandas, T5 models, and Plotly to preprocess data and created interac- tive charts from natural language / Voice inputs. Used RapidFuzz for fuzzy column matching and Torch for AI-generated charts and filters with dynamic multi-chart dashboards featuring global filtering.
